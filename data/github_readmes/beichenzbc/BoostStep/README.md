## 💡 Highlights
- 🔥 **Step-level Example Problem Bank** We develop a step-level example problem bank according to reasoning content instead of grammatical separation

- 🔥 **Step-level In-context Learning** We align the granularity between the retrieving and reasoning on step grained and provides highly related ICL examples for each reasoning step with a novel `first-try' strategy

- 🔥 **Strong Performance** We improve GPT-4o and Qwen2.5-Math-72B by 3.6\% and 2.0\% respectively on various mathematical benchmarks comparing to problem-level few-shot learning, and further obtain 7.5\% gain combined with MCTS.

## 📜 News
🚀 [2025/1/21] The inference code of BoostStep is released

🚀 [2025/1/7] The example problem bank and the AMC test set are released

🚀 [2025/1/7] The paper is released!

## 🛠️ Usage

The inference code is released, you can run our booststep on AMC-12 benchmark by the following command:
```shell
python reasoning.py --api_key="Your_API_KEY"
```

Then, run `check_answer-4o-option.py` to judge your answer with GPT-4o.

Here we demonstrate a specific example. Given the question, we first let the model to have a first-try on step one. Unfortunately, the model makes an error on tangent sum formula, therefore leading to a wrong step. Then, we find a similar step which correctly leverage tangent sum formula in the step-level example problem bank according to this first-try. Therefore, with the guidance provided, the model correctly applied the tangent sum formula during the second reasoning attempt and arrived at the correct answer.
