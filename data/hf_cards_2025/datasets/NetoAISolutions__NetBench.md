## Dataset Structure

Each instance contains a question-answer pair with associated contextual information. The dataset is provided in tabular formats such as CSV or JSON, with the following columns:

| Field          | Type    | Description                                                   |
|----------------|---------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `Main Category`| String  | High-level network domain (e.g., Network - Configuration)     |
| `Category`     | String  | Specific sub-domain or protocol (e.g., Routing Protocols Config) |
| `Scenario_ID`  | Integer | Unique identifier for each scenario                           |
| `Context`      | String  | Background description or scenario context                    |
| `Question`     | String  | Technical question related to the scenario                    |
| `Answer`       | String  | Expert-level, detailed response with reasoning and best practices |



## Data Splits

- **Size:** Approximately 5390 instances  

- No predefined splits — users can create custom train/test splits based on `Main Category`, `Category`, or other criteria.


## Dataset Creation

- **Curation Rationale:**  
  To create a high-quality, expert-validated dataset addressing real-world network engineering problems to foster AI-driven automation, diagnostics, and education.

- **Source Data:**  
  Contributions from network subject matter experts (SMEs) referencing authentic industry scenarios and standards.

- **Annotations:**  
  Answers are composed and reviewed by SMEs for technical accuracy, clarity, and adherence to best practices and networking protocols.



## Example Data Instance

| Main Category           | Category                        | Scenario_ID | Context                                                                                      | Question                                                                                         | Answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Network - Configuration | Routing Protocols Config (All Vendors) | 461         | BGP Path Selection: Router receives two paths for prefix 10.1.0.0/16. Path A: Higher Local Preference, Longer AS_PATH. Path B: Lower Local Preference, Shorter AS_PATH. | Which BGP path (A or B) will the router prefer by default for prefix 10.1.0.0/16, and why?      | Path A will be preferred. BGP path selection prioritizes the path with the highest Local Preference before considering AS_PATH length. Although Path B has a shorter AS_PATH, Path A’s higher Local Preference makes it more desirable. |



## Usage Example

Here is an example of how to load and filter the dataset using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
df = pd.read_csv("NetBench.csv")

# Filter scenarios related to BGP routing configuration
bgp_scenarios = df[df["Category"] == "Routing Protocols Config (All Vendors)"]

# Display sample questions and answers
print(bgp_scenarios[["Question", "Answer"]].head())
```



## Limitations and Considerations

* **Scenario Selection Bias:**
  Focuses mainly on commonly used protocols such as BGP and OSPF; niche or emerging technologies may be underrepresented.

* **Vendor Bias:**
  While vendor-agnostic, scenarios may implicitly reflect common vendors like Cisco or Juniper.

* **Size:**
  Dataset size (5.39k) may not cover all possible edge cases.

* **Language:**
  English-only dataset limits accessibility to non-English speakers.

* **Vendor-Specificity:**
  Some answers might require vendor-specific interpretation when applied practically.



## Social Impact

This dataset supports advancements in telecom network automation, troubleshooting, and education — improving operational efficiency and helping train the next generation of network professionals.



## Future Directions

* Expanding coverage to emerging network technologies (e.g., 6G, SDN, NFV).
* Adding multilingual support to increase global accessibility.
* Introducing metadata such as difficulty level and vendor specificity for more granular use.
