## Benchmark

SimpleQA Verified is a 1,000-prompt benchmark for reliably evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on short-form factuality 
and parametric knowledge. The authors from Google DeepMind and Google Research build on [SimpleQA](https://openai.com/index/introducing-simpleqa/), 
originally designed by [Wei et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04368) at OpenAI, and address limitations including noisy and incorrect labels, topical biases, and question redundancy. 
Similar to SimpleQA, model responses are graded with a GPT-4.1 version. The autorater prompt has been modified with a focus on forcing direct answers, 
preventing guessing in long responses, and improving the grading of numeric answer types. SimpleQA Verified was created to provide the research 
community with a more precise instrument to track genuine progress in factuality, 
discourage overfitting to benchmark artifacts, and ultimately foster the development of more trustworthy AI systems. 

## Dataset Description

This dataset is a collection 1,000 examples crafted by humans for evaluating short-format parametric factuality in LLMs. Each example is composed of:

* An index (`original_index`) indicating which questions in the original [SimpleQA](https://openai.com/index/introducing-simpleqa/) benchmark the example corresponds to
* A problem (`problem`) which is the prompt testing parametric knowledge, e.g. "*To whom did Mehbooba Mufti Sayed contest the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and lose?*"
* A gold answer (`answer`) which is used in conjunction with the evaluation prompt to judge the correctness of an LLM's response
* A topic (`topic`) and answer type (`answer_type`) classification – from the original [SimpleQA](https://openai.com/index/introducing-simpleqa/) paper, and re-classified where appropriate
* Two additional metadata fields `multi_step` and `requires_reasoning` indicating whether the question requires information from multiple sources and whether it requires more complex reasoning
* Golden URLs (`urls`) which are a list of at least two URLs supporting the gold answer (`answer`), collected from SimpleQA human raters and adjusted by the authors of SimpleQA Verified

See the [Technical Report](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07968) for methodology details.

## Limitations
SimpleQA Verified is meant to be be used without any tools (i.e. search or retrieval tools). With tools, the benchmark is trivial to solve which defeats its purpose.

## Evaluation Prompt
The evaluation prompt employed by SimpleQA Verified using GPT-4.1 as an autorater mode can be found in the [starter notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/nanliao7/simpleqa-verified-benchmark-starter-code) on Kaggle.
