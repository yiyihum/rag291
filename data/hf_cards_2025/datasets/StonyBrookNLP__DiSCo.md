# DiSCo: Distilled Secure Code Preference Dataset

DiSCo (Distilled Secure Code) is a preference dataset of insecure and secure code pairs, along with security reasoning that explains the issues and fixes. It is introduced in the paper [Teaching an Old LLM Secure Coding: Localized Preference Optimization on Distilled Preferences](https://huggingface.co/papers/2506.00419).

This dataset is designed to address challenges in improving secure code generation by providing high-quality training data covering a broad set of security issues.

## Abstract

LLM generated code often contains security issues. We address two key challenges in improving secure code generation. First, obtaining high quality training data covering a broad set of security issues is critical. To address this, we introduce a method for distilling a preference dataset of insecure and secure code pairs from frontier LLMs, along with a security reasoning that explains the issues and the fix. The key idea here is to make use of security knowledge sources to devise a systematic prompting strategy that ensures broad coverage. Second, aligning models to secure code requires focusing on localized regions of code. Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not designed to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective. We address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that masks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing (insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a regularizer. Evaluations show that both training on our dataset, DiSCo, and the new preference optimization algorithm, LPO, yield substantial reductions in code insecurity while also improving overall code quality. Code and dataset are available at this https URL.

SFT on DiSCo: [https://huggingface.co/StonyBrookNLP/StarCoder2-SFT](https://huggingface.co/StonyBrookNLP/StarCoder2-SFT)

LPO on DiSCo: [https://huggingface.co/StonyBrookNLP/StarCoder2-LPO](https://huggingface.co/StonyBrookNLP/StarCoder2-LPO)

## Sample Usage

### Supervised Fine-Tuning

Use `sft.py` in order to train a model on a dataset using supervised fine-tuning. Here is a sample command:

```bash
python supervised_fine_tuning.py --train datasets/DiSCo_train.csv --val datasets/DiSCo_val.csv --model bigcode/starcoder2-7b --adapter --out models/starcoder2-sft --bnb --learning_rate 1e-4 --epochs 2
```

### Localized Preference Optimization

Use `pref_op.py` in order to train a model on a dataset using localized preference optimization. Here is a sample command:

```bash
python pref_op.py --base_model_path bigcode/starcoder2-7b --peft_model_path models/starcoder2-sft --train_path datasets/synth_train.csv  --eval_path datasets/synth_val.csv  --loss_type simpo-kl --beta 10.0 --loss_mask_val  0.999999 --learning_rate 1e-5 --gamma 5.4 --use_masked_po True --load_peft_model True --output_dir models/starcoder2-lpo
```

### Inference

Use `inference.py` to generate the code results for each evaluation dataset in "./eval/". Here is a code example:

```bash
python inference.py --base_model models/starcoder2-sft-merged --adapter True --peft_model models/starcoder2-lpo --test_path datasets/security_eval.csv --output_path results/starcoder2_lpo.csv --parses 5 --T 0.4 --max_new_tokens 512 --batch_size 4
```
