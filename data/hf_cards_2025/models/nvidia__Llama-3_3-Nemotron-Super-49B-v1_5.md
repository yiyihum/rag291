# Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1.5

![image](./accuracy_chart.png)

## Model Overview 

Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1.5 is a significantly upgraded version of Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1 and is a large language model (LLM) which is a derivative of Meta Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct (AKA the reference model). It is a reasoning model that is post trained for reasoning, human chat preferences, and agentic tasks, such as RAG and tool calling. The model supports a context length of 128K tokens.

Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1.5 is a model which offers a great tradeoff between model accuracy and efficiency. Efficiency (throughput) directly translates to savings. Using a novel Neural Architecture Search (NAS) approach, we greatly reduce the model’s memory footprint, enabling larger workloads, as well as fitting the model on a single GPU at high workloads (H200). This NAS approach enables the selection of a desired point in the accuracy-efficiency tradeoff. For more information on the NAS approach, please refer to [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19146)

The model underwent a multi-phase post-training process to enhance both its reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This includes a supervised fine-tuning stage for Math, Code, Science, and Tool Calling. Additionally, the model went through multiple stages of Reinforcement Learning (RL) including Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) for chat, Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for reasoning, and iterative Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for Tool Calling capability enhancements. The final checkpoint was achieved after merging several RL and DPO checkpoints.

This model is part of the Llama Nemotron Collection. You can find the other model(s) in this family here:

## Model Architecture

**Architecture Type:** Dense decoder-only Transformer model

**Network Architecture:** Llama 3.3 70B Instruct, customized through Neural Architecture Search (NAS)

The model is a derivative of Meta’s Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct, using Neural Architecture Search (NAS). The NAS algorithm results in non-standard and non-repetitive blocks. This includes the following: 

Skip attention: In some blocks, the attention is skipped entirely, or replaced with a single linear layer.
Variable FFN: The expansion/compression ratio in the FFN layer is different between blocks. 

We utilize a block-wise distillation of the reference model, where for each block we create multiple variants providing different tradeoffs of quality vs. computational complexity, discussed in more depth below. We then search over the blocks to create a model which meets the required throughput and memory (optimized for a single H100-80GB GPU) while minimizing the quality degradation. The model then undergoes knowledge distillation (KD), with a focus on English single and multi-turn chat use-cases. The KD step included 40 billion tokens consisting of a mixture of 3 datasets - FineWeb, Buzz-V1.2 and Dolma.

## Intended use

Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1.5 is a general purpose reasoning and chat model intended to be used in English and coding languages. Other non-English languages (German, French, Italian, Portuguese, Hindi, Spanish, and Thai) are also supported. 

## Input

Our AI models are designed and/or optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA’s hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.

## Model Version
1.5 (07/25/2025)

## Software Integration
- **Runtime Engine:** Transformers

- **Recommended Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility:** 
  - NVIDIA Ampere 
  - NVIDIA Hopper 
- **Preferred Operating System(s):** Linux 

## Quick Start and Usage Recommendations:

1. By default (empty system prompt) the model will respond in reasoning ON mode. Setting `/no_think` in the system prompt will enable reasoning OFF mode.
2. We recommend setting temperature to `0.6`, and Top P to `0.95` for Reasoning ON mode
3. We recommend using greedy decoding for Reasoning OFF mode

<think>
Okay, let's see. The user has a bill of $100 and wants to know the amount for an 18% tip. Hmm, I need to calculate the tip based on the bill total and the percentage. The tools provided include calculate_tip, which takes bill_total and tip_percentage as parameters. So the bill_total here is 100, and the tip_percentage is 18. I should call the calculate_tip function with these values. Wait, do I need to check if the parameters are integers? The bill is $100, which is an integer, and 18% is also an integer. So that fits the function's requirements. I don't need to convert any currency here because the user is asking about a tip in the same currency. So the correct tool to use is calculate_tip with those parameters.

## Training and Evaluation Datasets

## Training Datasets

A large variety of training data was used for the knowledge distillation phase before post-training pipeline, 3 of which included: FineWeb, Buzz-V1.2, and Dolma.

The data for the multi-stage post-training phases for improvements in Code, Math, and Reasoning is a compilation of SFT and RL data that supports improvements of math, code, general reasoning, and instruction following capabilities of the original Llama instruct model. 

Prompts have been sourced from either public and open corpus or synthetically generated. Responses were synthetically generated by a variety of models, with some prompts containing responses for both reasoning on and off modes, to train the model to distinguish between two modes. 

We have released our [Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset-v1](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset-v1) to promote openness and transparency in model development and improvement.
