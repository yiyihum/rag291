# Foundation-Sec-8B - Model Card

## Model Information

Foundation-Sec-8B (Llama-3.1-FoundationAI-SecurityLLM-base-8B) is an open-weight, 8-billion parameter base language model specialized for cybersecurity applications. It extends Llama-3.1-8B model through continued pretraining on a curated corpus of cybersecurity-specific text, including threat intelligence reports, vulnerability databases, incident response documentation, and security standards. It has been trained to understand security concepts, terminology, and practices across multiple security domains. The model is designed to serve as a domain-adapted base model for use in applications such as threat detection, vulnerability assessment, security automation, and attack simulation. Foundation-Sec-8B enables organizations to build AI-driven security tools that can be deployed locally, reducing dependency on cloud-based AI services while maintaining high performance on security-related tasks.

### Out-of-Scope Use

The following uses are out-of-scope and are neither recommended nor intended use cases:

1. **Generating harmful content** - The model should not be used to:
    - Generate malware or other malicious code
    - Create phishing content or social engineering scripts
    - Develop attack plans targeting specific organizations
    - Design exploitation techniques for vulnerabilities without legitimate security research purposes
2. **Critical security decisions without human oversight** - The model should not be used for:
    - Autonomous security decision-making without human review
    - Critical infrastructure protection without expert supervision
    - Final determination of security compliance without human verification
    - Autonomous vulnerability remediation without testing
3. **Legal or medical advice** - The model is not qualified to provide:
    - Legal advice regarding security regulations, compliance requirements, or intellectual property disputes
    - Legal advice regarding security issues that would reference legal statutes, precedents, or case law necessary to provide legal advice
    - Medical advice regarding health impacts of security incidents
4. **Non-security use cases** - The model is specifically optimized for cybersecurity and may not perform as well on general tasks as models trained for broader applications.
5. **Violation of Laws or Regulations** - Any use that violates applicable laws or regulations.

## Limitations

Foundation-Sec-8B has several limitations that users should be aware of:

1. **Domain-specific knowledge limitations**:
    - Foundation-Sec-8B may not be familiar with recent vulnerabilities, exploits, or novel attack vectors or security technologies released after its training cutoff date
    - Knowledge of specialized or proprietary security systems or tools may be limited
2. **Potential biases**:
    - The model may reflect biases present in security literature and documentation
    - The model may be trained on known attack patterns and have difficulty recognizing novel attack vectors
    - Security practices and recommendations may be biased toward certain technological ecosystems
    - Geographic and cultural biases in security approaches may be present
3. **Security risks**:
    - The model cannot verify the identity or intentions of users
    - Adversarial prompting techniques might potentially bypass safety mechanisms
    - The model may unintentionally provide information that could be misused if proper prompting guardrails are not implemented
4. **Contextual blindness:**
    - The model may struggle to understand the complex interrelationships between systems, users, and data in order to provide accurate context.
5. **Technical limitations**:
    - Performance varies based on how security concepts are described in prompts
    - May not fully understand complex, multi-step security scenarios without clear explanation
    - Cannot access external systems or actively scan environments
    - Cannot independently verify factual accuracy of its outputs
6. **Ethical considerations**:
    - Dual-use nature of security knowledge requires careful consideration of appropriate use cases
    

### Recommendations

To address the limitations of Foundation-Sec-8B, we recommend:

1. **Human oversight**:
    - Always have qualified security professionals review model outputs before implementation
    - Use the model as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for expert human judgment
    - Implement a human-in-the-loop approach for security-critical applications
2. **System design safeguards**:
    - Implement additional validation layers for applications built with this model
    - Consider architectural constraints that limit the model's ability to perform potentially harmful actions (excessive agency)
    - Deploy the model in environments with appropriate access controls
3. **Prompt engineering**:
    - Use carefully designed prompts that encourage ethical security practices
    - Include explicit instructions regarding responsible disclosure and ethical hacking principles
    - Structure interactions to minimize the risk of inadvertently harmful outputs
4. **Knowledge supplementation**:
    - Supplement the model with up-to-date security feeds and databases
    - Implement retrieval-augmented generation for current threat intelligence sources
5. **Usage policies**:
    - Develop and enforce clear acceptable use policies for applications using this model
    - Implement monitoring and auditing for high-risk applications
    - Create documentation for end users about the model's limitations
