# OpenReasoning-Nemotron-14B Overview

## Description: <br>
OpenReasoning-Nemotron-14B is a large language model (LLM) which is a derivative of Qwen2.5-14B (AKA the reference model). It is a reasoning model that is post-trained for reasoning about math, code and science solution generation. We evaluated this model with up to 64K output tokens. The OpenReasoning model is available in the following sizes: 1.5B, 7B and 14B and 32B. <br>

This model is ready for commercial/non-commercial research use. <br>

## Combining the work of multiple agents
OpenReasoning-Nemotron models can be used in a "heavy" mode by starting multiple parallel generations and combining them together via [generative solution selection (GenSelect)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16891). To add this "skill" we follow the original GenSelect training pipeline except we do not train on the selection summary but use the full reasoning trace of DeepSeek R1 0528 671B instead. We only train models to select the best solution for math problems but surprisingly find that this capability directly generalizes to code and science questions! With this "heavy" GenSelect inference mode, OpenReasoning-Nemotron-32B model surpasses O3 (High) on math and coding benchmarks.

## How to use the models?

To run inference on coding problems:

````python
import transformers
import torch
model_id = "nvidia/OpenReasoning-Nemotron-14B"
pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_id,
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16},
    device_map="auto",
)
# Code generation prompt
prompt = """You are a helpful and harmless assistant. You should think step-by-step before responding to the instruction below.
Please use python programming language only.
You must use ```python for just the final solution code block with the following format:
```python
# Your code here
```
{user}
"""

# Math generation prompt
# prompt = """Solve the following math problem. Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \\boxed{}.
# 
# {user}
# """

# Science generation prompt
# You can refer to prompts here -
# https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills/blob/main/nemo_skills/prompt/config/generic/hle.yaml (HLE)
# https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills/blob/main/nemo_skills/prompt/config/eval/aai/mcq-4choices-boxed.yaml (for GPQA)
# https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills/blob/main/nemo_skills/prompt/config/eval/aai/mcq-10choices-boxed.yaml (MMLU-Pro)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user",
        "content": prompt.format(user="Write a program to calculate the sum of the first $N$ fibonacci numbers")},
]
outputs = pipeline(
    messages,
    max_new_tokens=64000,
)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1]['content'])
````

We have added [a simple transformer-based script](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/OpenReasoning-Nemotron-14B/blob/main/genselect_hf.py) in this repo to illustrate GenSelect.  
To learn how to use the models in GenSelect mode with NeMo-Skills, see our [documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo-Skills/releases/openreasoning/evaluation/).

To use the model with GenSelect inference, we recommend following our 
[reference implementation in NeMo-Skills](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills/blob/main/nemo_skills/pipeline/genselect.py). Alternatively, you can manually extract the summary from all solutions and use this 
[prompt](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills/blob/main/nemo_skills/prompt/config/openmath/genselect.yaml) for the math problems. We will add the prompt we used for the coding problems and a reference implementation soon!
