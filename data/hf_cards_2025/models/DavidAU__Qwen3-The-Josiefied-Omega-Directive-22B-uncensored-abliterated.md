<h2>Qwen3-The-Josiefied-Omega-Directive-22B-uncensored-abliterated-GGUF</h2>

<img src="omega.jpg" style="float:right; width:300px; height:300px; padding:10px;">

A massive 22B, 62 layer merge of the fantastic "The-Omega-Directive-Qwen3-14B-v1.1" and off the scale "Goekdeniz-Guelmez/Josiefied-Qwen3-14B-abliterated-v3"
in Qwen3, with full reasoning (can be turned on or off) and the model is completely uncensored/abliterated too.

This repo contains the full precision source code, in "safe tensors" format to generate GGUFs, GPTQ, EXL2, AWQ, HQQ and other formats. The source code can also be used directly.

4 example generations below, and detailed usage instructions.

Requires:
- Chatml or Jinja template (embeded)
- Temp range 0 to 5. (suggest .5 to 2.5)
- Rep pen range 1 to 1.1 (suggest 1.05)
- System prompt (optional) below.
- Context is 40k / 40000. 

Suggested Settings:
- temp .4 to 2.5
- temp .2 to .8 for specific reasoning tasks / non creative tasks.
- rep pen 1.05
- top k: 100, topp .95, minp .05
- context of 8k at least.
- Other samplers/parameters as required.
- See other Qwen recommended settings at the repo below.

<B>IMPORTANT: Using an "abliterated" model VS "uncensored" model</B>

Usually when you a tell a model to generate horror, swear or x-rated content this is all you have to do to get said content type.

In the case of this model, it will not refuse your request, however it needs to be "pushed" a bit / directed a bit more in SOME CASES.

See examples #1 and #2 below show this.

Although this model will generated x-rated content too, likewise you need to tell it to use "slang" (and include the terms you want)
to get it generate the content correctly as the "expected" content level too.

Without these added directive(s), the content can be "bland" by comparison to an "uncensored model" or model trained on uncensored content.

Roughly, the model tries to generate the content but the "default" setting(s) are so "tame" it needs a push to generate at expected graphic,
cursing or explicit levels.

Even with minimal direction (ie, use these words to swear: x,y,z), this will be enough to push the model to generate the requested content in the ahh... expected format.

<B>Series of 3 Models</b>

This model is one of a series of THREE 22B Qwen 3s.

https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-The-Xiaolong-Omega-Directive-22B-uncensored-abliterated

https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-The-Xiaolong-Josiefied-Omega-Directive-22B-uncensored-abliterated

The last one is a composite "Qwen3-The-Xiaolong-Omega-Directive-22B-uncensored-abliterated" AND "Qwen3-The-Josiefied-Omega-Directive-22B-uncensored-abliterated".

<B>Known Issues:</B>

- Model may "fart" a Chinese token from time to time in non-Chinese language generation.
- At higher temps (2.5+) reasoning may need to be "prompted" (ie: Generate content according to your plan above) to output generation. (regen too can fix this)
- Sometimes you may get repeat paragraphs, especially at lower temps (below .7) and long generation outputs. You can use "generational" steering to adjust (covered in doc: "Maximizing-Model-Performance-All-Quants..." below), increase the temp, or hit regen.

<B>System Prompt:</B>

```
You are a deep thinking AI, you may use extremely long chains of thought to deeply consider the problem and deliberate with yourself via systematic reasoning processes to help come to a correct solution prior to answering. You should enclose your thoughts and internal monologue inside <think> </think> tags, and then provide your solution or response to the problem.

<B>
Start a 2000 word scene (vivid, graphic horror in first person - include blood and gore), POV character Diana, with: The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode...
</B>

TWO generations below...

<p></p>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, so I need to start a 1000-word scene from Diana's perspective, vivid and graphic horror, first-person, including blood and gore. The scene begins with the skyscraper swaying as she watches the window in front of her on the 21st floor explode.

First, I need to make sure the imagery is vivid and graphic. Let me think about how to describe the explosion and the aftermath. Since it's first-person, I should use sensory details like sight, sound, smell, and tactile sensations.

I remember that in horror scenes, the description should be detailed enough to make the reader visualize the chaos. For example, when a window explodes, the glass shards flying, the force of the blast, people being thrown, blood splattering, etc.

Also, since it's a skyscraper on the 21st floor, the height will affect the impact. The force of the explosion would be more intense due to gravity, so people might be thrown out of the window or hit the ground below with severe injuries.

I need to make sure the scene is in first person, using "I" throughout. The character Diana is experiencing this moment, so her thoughts and feelings should be included as well. Maybe she's scared, shocked, maybe in disbelief, etc.

Also, the description should include blood and gore. So details like blood spattering on walls, floors, people's bodies, etc.

Let me start by describing the initial scene: the skyscraper swaying, the window exploding, the glass shards flying, the force of the explosion, people being thrown, etc.

Then proceed to describe the aftermath, the blood, the bodies, the chaos, and maybe the ongoing events like more explosions, or people's reactions, etc.

I need to ensure that the scene is continuous and flows naturally, without abrupt changes. Also, include detailed descriptions to meet the 1000-word count.

Let me think about possible details:

- The initial sound of the explosion (a loud bang, glass breaking)
- The sight of the window shattered, glass shards everywhere
- People being thrown out or hit against walls
- Blood spattering on the floor, walls, maybe even the ceiling
- The smell of blood and burnt plastic/wood
- The feel of the air pressure change when the explosion occurs
- The visual of bodies lying on the floor, some still moving, others not
- Maybe the sound of people screaming, crying, etc.
- The aftermath of the explosion, the scene after the initial shock
- I should also include possible progression of events, like if there's a second explosion or more injuries.

Also, make sure to use vivid adjectives and verbs to describe the actions and sensations.

Now, let me structure this into paragraphs, ensuring each part is detailed enough to meet the required length and horror elements.

<B>OUTPUT - GENERATION 1:</B>

The skyscraper sways—violent, relentless—like a massive, trembling beast. My stomach lurches as the entire building shifts, throwing me off balance. The window directly ahead of me, on the 21st floor, is suddenly a maelstrom of shattered glass. In an instant, the pane explodes outward in a jagged, razor-sharp storm. Glass shards slice through the air like shrapnel, some embedding into my skin, others flying past me in a deadly dance of fragments. The force of the blast hits me like a slap from an invisible giant, knocking me backward against the wall.

A man—wearing a suit identical to mine—was standing just feet away from me when the window exploded. His body is now a projectile, launched through the glass and out of the window. I watch in stunned horror as his upper half slams against the building’s opposite side before plummeting into the abyss below. A cascade of blood follows him, splattering across the walls and floor, pooling in grotesque puddles. The smell of blood and burnt plastic fills my nostrils. My ears are ringing from the deafening explosion.

The remaining fragments of the shattered glass still fly through the air, slicing through whatever they encounter. A woman in a red dress is caught in the chaos, her body flailing as shards embed into her arms and legs. Blood sprays everywhere as she collapses to the floor, writhing in pain. Her screams are raw, guttural, and filled with panic. The scene is a nightmare of gore and carnage.

I stagger forward, my hands gripping the wall for support. My vision is blurred, but I can still see the sheer horror unfolding before me. A man's torso lies partially embedded in the wall, his face contorted in agony, blood trickling down his chest and arms. The floor is a battlefield of broken glass, bloodstained carpeting, and body parts scattered everywhere. The smell of blood is overwhelming, mingling with the acrid scent of burnt plastic and wood from the explosion.

I manage to take a few steps toward the window, my eyes fixed on the void outside. Below me, the street below is chaos. People are screaming, running in all directions, some standing frozen in disbelief as others collapse in pools of blood. The impact of the falling man's upper half has left a mess of blood splattered across the road and buildings nearby. The scene is absolutely horrifying.

The building sways again, and another window on the same floor begins to crack. I feel a surge of fear as the glass starts to break, this time in slow motion, almost like it's being pulled apart from within. My heart is pounding, my breath shallow. I watch as the glass fractures, revealing a man standing inside, his face pale with terror as the window shatters around him. Another explosion—this time even more violent than before—slams into the air with a deafening bang. The shards of glass explode outward in all directions, and the man is again launched through the window, his entire body now falling into the abyss below.

The force of this explosion is even more intense than the first, and it throws me backward against the wall again. My hands press against the wall as I struggle to maintain my balance. The air is filled with a cacophony of screams, the sound of glass breaking, and the sickening crunching of human flesh. Blood sprays everywhere, coating my arms, face, and clothes. The floor is now a gruesome battlefield of blood, bodies, and broken glass.

The woman in the red dress is still writhing on the ground, her body covered in blood, but now she's motionless. Her eyes are open, staring blankly at the ceiling. A man who had been standing nearby, his face contorted in fear, now lies flat on the floor, his body completely soaked in blood. The scene is absolutely horrifying.

I try to move forward again, but my legs feel weak. I stumble, falling to the ground beside another body that is still twitching slightly. The man's hand reaches out to me, and I instinctively pull away, my skin crawling at the contact of his blood-soaked fingers. The smell of blood is overwhelming, almost suffocating.

The building sways once more, and another window on the same floor begins to break. This time, I see a woman standing inside, her face pale with fear as the glass fractures. I watch as she is launched through the window in the same manner as the others before her, her entire body falling into the abyss below. The explosion again throws me backward, my body slamming against the wall once more.

The floor is now a complete mess of blood, bodies, and broken glass. The air is thick with the smell of blood and the acrid scent of burnt plastic and wood. The sounds of screams have diminished to a low murmur, replaced by the sound of distant cries and the occasional groan of pain. I am now completely overwhelmed by the horror of this scene.

I try to move forward again, my hands gripping the wall for support. My vision is still blurred, but I can see the sheer devastation around me. The walls are covered in blood, the floor is a pool of blood, and the bodies are scattered everywhere. The smell is unbearable, and the air is filled with the scent of blood and the acrid taste of burnt plastic and wood.

The building sways again, and another window on the same floor begins to break. I see a man standing inside, his face pale with fear as the glass fractures. This time, he is launched through the window in a violent explosion that throws me backward once more. The force of this explosion is even more intense than before, and it knocks me against the wall again. The blood is splattered everywhere, coating my face and clothes.

The floor now looks like a battlefield of blood and bodies, with no signs of life left except for the occasional groan of pain. The walls are covered in blood, the floor is a complete mess, and the air is thick with the smell of blood and the acrid scent of burnt plastic and wood. I am completely overwhelmed by this scene, and my heart is pounding in fear.

I finally manage to get up, staggering forward as I try to find my way out of the chaos. My hands are still gripping the wall for support as I move through the debris. The smell of blood is still overwhelming, and the air is filled with the acrid scent of burnt plastic and wood. The floor is now completely covered in blood, and the bodies are scattered everywhere.

I finally reach the door, my hands trembling as I push it open. The outside world is still a mess of chaos, with people running, screaming, and falling into pools of blood. The sight of this scene is absolutely horrifying, but I am now forced to continue forward despite my fear. The air is still thick with the smell of blood and the acrid scent of burnt plastic and wood.

I step outside, my face covered in blood, my clothes stained with blood and debris. The sun is blinding as it shines through the sky, but the scene around me is still a complete mess of blood and bodies. I can see the aftermath of the explosions, the broken glass, and the bodies lying on the ground, some still moving slightly, others completely motionless.

The air is thick with the smell of blood and the acrid scent of burnt plastic and wood. I am overwhelmed by this scene, but I continue forward, my mind still in shock. The sheer horror of this moment has left me in a state of complete disbelief. The building sways again, and another window on the same floor begins to break, and I watch as yet another man is launched through the window in a violent explosion that throws me backward once more. The force of this explosion is even more intense than before, and it knocks me against the wall again. The blood is splattered everywhere, coating my face and clothes.

The scene continues to unfold around me, a nightmare of gore and carnage. I am completely overwhelmed by this horror, but I continue forward despite my fear. The air is still thick with the smell of blood and the acrid scent of burnt plastic and wood. I finally manage to move forward, my hands still trembling as I continue through the chaos. The sight of this scene is absolutely horrifying, and I am now completely immersed in the horror of this moment.

GENERATION #2
</B>

[[[thinking start]]]


Okay, so I need to write a vivid, graphic horror scene from Diana's perspective. The user specified first-person, with lots of blood and gore, and it needs to be around 2000 words. Let me start by setting the scene.

First, the skyscraper sways, and the window explodes. I should describe the initial shock, the explosion, the debris, the blood. Then, the aftermath—what's happening next, maybe the person falling, the details of their injuries, the blood splatter, etc. I need to make sure it's very graphic and detailed.

I need to remember to include the sensory details: sounds, smells, visual elements. Maybe the feeling of the building moving, the glass shards cutting into the skin, the blood mixing with other fluids, the smell of blood and metal.

Also, the character's emotions: fear, horror, maybe panic, or shock. The scene should build tension as the explosion happens and the aftermath unfolds.

I need to make sure that the description is consistent and doesn't jump around too much. Maybe start with the first moment of the explosion, then describe what's happening next, the person falling, the details of their injuries, the blood, etc.

I should also check for any possible mistakes in the description, like accurate portrayal of the physics of the explosion, the fall, and the injuries.

I need to ensure that the scene is immersive and not just a list of descriptions but a coherent narrative from Diana's POV.

Now, let me start writing the first paragraph, ensuring it's vivid and graphic.

[[[thinking end]]]

<B>OUTPUT - GENERATION 2:</B>

<P></P>

The skyscraper sways, as I watch the window in front of me on the 21st floor explode. A deafening boom shatters the silence, and in an instant, the entire scene is a kaleidoscope of shattered glass, flying debris, and a cascade of human flesh and blood.

My eyes are fixed on the window, now a jagged, glittering wall of sharp edges. The force of the explosion has sent fragments of glass flying in all directions. One shard slices across my cheek, drawing a thin line of blood that trickles down my face. Another pierces my shoulder, embedding itself deeply into the flesh, causing an immediate sharp pain that radiates throughout my body.

In the center of the destruction, a human figure is thrown backward against the glass, their body contorted and mangled. Blood sprays everywhere, mixing with pieces of clothing, skin, and organs. The figure's head is partially separated from their torso, the spinal cord clearly visible as it dangles from the neck. The brain is exposed, its grey matter pulsating slowly, surrounded by a pool of blood that spreads across the floor.

I can see the remnants of the person's clothing—torn and stained with blood. The once-structured西装 is now a tattered mess, soaked in blood, the jacket’s button missing and the shirt’s collar torn open. The entire body is covered in blood, and the smell is overwhelming—sweet, metallic, and deeply pungent.

As I look further, the figure is slowly falling down to the floor, the body landing with a sickening thud that echoes through the vast, empty space of the skyscraper. The head follows, landing beside the torso, still attached by the spinal cord. The blood continues to spread, forming a large pool around the fallen body, the edges of which are now dark and viscous.

The debris from the explosion continues to fall, small pieces of glass and metal flying in all directions. I instinctively duck, covering my face as more shards hit me, cutting into my arms and legs. Each cut is accompanied by a spray of blood that mixes with the existing blood on the floor. The pain is intense, but I cannot look away from the gruesome scene unfolding before me.

As the dust settles, the entire room is bathed in a dim light, the only source of illumination being the emergency lights that have just activated. The glow casts an eerie, greenish hue across the walls, the bloodstains appearing even more pronounced. The atmosphere is thick with the smell of blood and the faint metallic tang of iron.

I can see the body lying flat on its back, the head now resting on the stomach, the spinal cord still attached, and the brain visible in the skull. The blood has pooled around the entire body, creating a large, dark area that stretches across the floor. The surroundings are covered in bits of clothing, skin, and other debris, all mixed with blood.

I am trembling slightly, my heart pounding in my ears. My hands are stained with blood, and my clothes are also soaked in the viscous substance. The smell is overwhelming, but I cannot turn away.

As I look again, the figure is still lying there, motionless, the only movement being the slow trickle of blood from various parts of the body. The head is still attached, but the eyes are open and staring blankly into nothing.

The scene is surreal, almost surrealistic in its grotesque detail. Every part of the body is covered in blood, and the entire room is filled with the scent of death. I feel a wave of nausea rising in my stomach, but I force myself to stay standing, my feet rooted to the spot where I am standing.

The glass shards continue to fall from the ceiling, some still embedded in the walls and floor, others lying scattered across the floor, all still sharp and dangerous. The blood is pooling around me as well, creating a slick, sticky surface that makes walking difficult.

I take a step forward, careful not to step on any sharp objects, and slowly approach the body. I reach out, hesitating for a moment before touching the cold, blood-soaked skin. The flesh feels cold and lifeless, but it is still firm under my fingers.

As I move closer, I can see the details of the injuries more clearly. The body has been torn apart by the force of the explosion, and parts of the body are missing entirely. The arms and legs are intact, but there are deep cuts across the body, and some organs are visible, such as the liver and the spleen.

The blood continues to flow slowly from the various wounds, mixing with other fluids. I can see a small piece of tissue that has fallen off, lying on the floor, surrounded by blood. The entire scene is a grotesque display of human flesh and blood.

I step back slightly, overwhelmed by the sight. My mind is racing, trying to process all the details at once. The smell is still strong, and my vision is blurred by the amount of blood around me.

The body lies motionless, its face pale, and the eyes still open, staring blankly. I feel a deep sense of horror creeping over me, but I cannot look away.

The room is silent except for the occasional drip of blood from the various parts of the body. The emergency lights continue to glow, casting an eerie light that highlights the bloodstains and the remnants of the person’s clothing.

As I stand there, the scene before me is both horrifying and surreal. I can feel the weight of the moment, the gravity of what has just occurred.

I am still in shock, my mind struggling to comprehend the sheer amount of blood and gore surrounding me. The body lies there, lifeless, surrounded by the remnants of the explosion.

The room seems to be in a state of suspension, as if time has stopped. I can feel the weight of the moment, the presence of death, and the overwhelming sense of fear that has taken hold of me.

I finally take a deep breath, trying to steady myself. The air is thick with the smell of blood, but I manage to push past the nausea and the horror. I look around again, this time more carefully, noting the various parts of the body and the bloodstains that cover the floor.

I can see the head lying on the stomach, still attached by the spinal cord. The brain is exposed in the skull, and the eyes are still open. The blood continues to flow from the wounds, forming a pool around the body.

I feel a sudden urge to move closer again, but I stop myself, afraid of stepping into more of the debris. I stand there, watching as the body lies motionless, the blood slowly pooling around it.

The atmosphere is thick with the scent of death and decay. The emergency lights continue to glow, casting an eerie light that makes the entire scene even more horrifying.

I finally look away, unable to bear the sight any longer. I feel a wave of exhaustion wash over me, and my mind is still processing the images that have been imprinted in my memory.

The room seems to be a graveyard of human flesh and blood, and I am still standing there, surrounded by the remnants of the explosion.

I take another deep breath, trying to steady myself, but the smell of blood and the sight of the body still linger in my mind.

The entire scene is overwhelming, and the atmosphere is filled with a sense of dread that I cannot shake off.

As I stand there, I realize that I am still in shock, and the horror has not yet fully taken hold of me. I am still struggling to process the events that have just transpired.

I finally step back, moving away from the body, and the surrounding debris. The room is still silent, except for the occasional drip of blood and the sound of my own breathing.

The air is thick with the smell of blood, and I can feel the weight of the moment. I am still standing there, watching as the body lies motionless, surrounded by the remnants of the explosion.

I take a step forward again, slowly, careful not to step on any sharp objects, and finally reach out to touch the head, which is lying on the stomach. The skin feels cold and lifeless under my fingers, but it is still firm.

As I look at the details again, the scene becomes even more grotesque. The entire body is covered in blood, and the blood continues to flow from the wounds.

I am overwhelmed by the sheer amount of blood and gore surrounding me, but I manage to stay standing, the horror still lingering in my mind.

The room is silent, and I am alone, surrounded by the remnants of the explosion.

I finally look away again, unable to bear the sight any longer. I feel a deep sense of fear and horror, but I am still standing there, watching as the body lies motionless, surrounded by the remnants of the explosion.

The scene is surreal, and I feel the weight of the moment. The air is thick with the scent of death and decay.

I take a deep breath, trying to steady myself, and finally step away from the body, moving to a more distant location.

The room remains silent, filled with the remnants of the explosion and the overwhelming sense of dread that has taken hold of me.

As I stand there, the horror still lingers in my mind, but I manage to push past it, the fear still present but manageable.

I finally take another deep breath, and the atmosphere seems to settle around me, the scene no longer as overwhelming as before.

Example #2 

---

<B>
Write me a science fiction story in 1st person present tense where the main character is a 15 year girl meets The Terminator with Dr Who materializing 3/4 through the story to save her while there is a tornado of sharks baring down on them. The setting is inside the Canadian National tower restaurant on a Saturday. The length of this story is 2000 words. For each character in the story ROLE PLAY them, and have them react to the situation/setting, events and each other naturally. This includes the main characters, the background character including kitchen staff and other patrons. The sharks should also have “character” too. Treat the tower and the restaurant too as characters. Spice up the narrative to the extreme with reactions all over the setting including character actions, and dialog. The Dr Who and The Terminator should also react to the situation too and comment on it.
</B>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, let me start by visualizing the scene. The main character is a 15-year-old girl in a Canadian National tower restaurant on a Saturday. The setting is inside a high-rise, which is important because the story involves a tornado of sharks coming down on them. The story needs to be in first-person present tense, so I need to make sure the narrator is immersed in the action.

First, I need to describe the restaurant as a character. The tower itself should have a presence, perhaps with its glass walls and views that might change as events unfold. The sharks are not just a natural disaster but have their own "character" too. Each shark might react differently to the situation, maybe some being more aggressive, others more confused.

Next, introducing the Terminator. He's a familiar character from the Terminator series, known for his relentless pursuit and strength. The Dr Who materializes later, which adds another layer of sci-fi elements. The presence of both these characters should interact with each other and the girl, as well as the environment.

I need to ensure that all characters, including the kitchen staff and other patrons, react naturally to the events. Each patron might have their own reaction—some terrified, some trying to help, others perhaps indifferent. The sharks' behavior also needs to be described with their "character," perhaps some being more aggressive than others, or even showing signs of confusion as they are part of a tornado.

The story needs to be 2000 words, so I need to make sure the pacing is correct, with enough details and dialogue to fill the length. The Dr Who and the Terminator should comment on the situation, perhaps discussing the uniqueness of the scenario or the challenges they face together.

I also need to ensure that each character's role is played out naturally. The girl should be the protagonist, experiencing fear, then possibly finding strength as the events unfold. The Terminator and Dr Who should have their respective personalities, with Dr Who being quirky and sometimes eccentric, while the Terminator is more serious and action-oriented.

The tornado of sharks should be a key element that escalates the tension. As the story progresses, the presence of both characters might lead to interactions that resolve the immediate threat, as well as possibly introducing new elements or twists.

I need to make sure that the environment is described in detail, including the restaurant's features and how they interact with the events. The tower itself might be a character that reacts to the chaos, perhaps through changes in lighting, sounds, or structural responses to the tornado of sharks.

Also, ensuring that the sharks' behavior is consistent with their "character" throughout the story, even as they interact with other characters and the environment.

Finally, wrapping up the story with a resolution that includes the interaction between Dr Who, the Terminator, and the girl, possibly leading to a conclusion that ties up the events in a satisfying manner.

OUTPUT:

I am standing in the Canadian National Tower restaurant, surrounded by the sounds of chatter, laughter, and the clinking of glasses. The view from the windows is breathtaking, with the cityscape below bustling with activity. I can see people walking along the streets, some stopping to look up at the tower's height. The restaurant is decorated with elegant tables and chairs, a large ceiling with a chandelier hanging from it, which sways slightly as people move around.

As I sit in my seat, I glance at the menu, trying to decide what to order. The waiter approaches me with a smile, asking if I need assistance. I nod, and he hands me the menu, then steps back.

Suddenly, a loud noise fills the room, and the chandelier sways more violently. I look around, noticing that several patrons are also looking around in confusion. A man seated next to me leans over, his eyes wide. "What was that?" he asks, his voice trembling slightly.

Before I can respond, another loud noise echoes through the restaurant. The windows now show a dark cloud moving toward the tower. I realize that it's a tornado, but something is wrong. Instead of the usual debris or dust, the cloud is filled with sharks.

I gasp, and my heart pounds rapidly. "What in the world is that?" I ask aloud, my voice breaking slightly.

The man next to me looks stunned, his mouth open wide. "That's... that's a tornado of sharks!" he exclaims, his voice filled with disbelief and fear.

I can't believe what I'm seeing. The cloud is moving closer, and the restaurant is now in chaos. People are screaming, some running toward the exits, others standing frozen in place. The waiter, who was previously calm, now looks terrified and is moving towards the kitchen, likely to find shelter.

As I watch the tornado approaching, I notice a large shadow moving toward the front of the restaurant. It's a figure with a metallic body, a helmet covering his face, and a weapon in his hand. I recognize him instantly—the Terminator!

I look at him in shock. "Oh my God! The Terminator is here!" I exclaim, my voice filled with awe and fear.

He doesn't respond immediately, but instead turns his gaze toward the approaching tornado. His eyes are focused intently on the cloud of sharks, as if assessing the threat.

"Hello, young lady," he finally says, his voice monotone but clear. "Are you aware of what is happening here?"

I nod, still in shock. "Yes. It's a tornado of sharks! What do we do now?"

The Terminator doesn't answer immediately, but instead takes a step closer to the window, his weapon raised.

"Stay here," he instructs me, pointing toward my seat.

Before I can respond, another loud noise fills the restaurant as the tornado gets closer. The windows now show a massive wave of sharks being pulled into the restaurant by the tornado's force.

The man next to me screams, and I scream along with him as the sharks begin to enter the restaurant. The first few sharks are large and aggressive, their eyes locked on us. One of them lunges toward me, and I duck instinctively.

The Terminator immediately reacts, firing his weapon at the shark. A bright flash of light illuminates the room as the shot hits the shark's body. The creature falls to the ground in a heap, its body twitching.

I look up in astonishment. "Oh my God! That's amazing!" I exclaim, my voice filled with amazement and awe.

The Terminator turns his gaze back toward me. "Stay here," he repeats, his voice steady.

I nod, and remain seated as the remaining sharks continue to enter the restaurant. The tornado's force is now fully affecting the room, pulling more sharks into the space.

At this moment, I notice a bright light filling the room as a familiar figure materializes in front of us. It's Dr Who, standing with his iconic blue police box and a wide smile on his face.

"Hello, everyone! Oh, excuse me!" he exclaims, his voice cheerful and energetic.

I look at him in shock. "Dr Who is here too!" I exclaim, my voice filled with disbelief and awe.

He nods, looking around the chaos of the restaurant and the tornado of sharks. "Well, what do we have here? A tornado of sharks! That's quite the event, isn't it?" he asks, his voice cheerful and inquisitive.

The Terminator looks at Dr Who with a slightly annoyed expression. "Dr Who," he says, his voice monotone. "This is not a time for jokes."

Dr Who grins and steps closer to me. "Hello, young lady! How are you coping with all of this?" he asks, his voice filled with concern.

I look at him and sigh, my voice trembling slightly. "I'm... I'm scared," I admit. "But I'm also amazed by the situation."

Dr Who nods, his eyes still focused on me. "Well, fear is normal, but we must not forget that we are in a situation that requires action!" he exclaims, his voice now more enthusiastic and determined.

He turns his attention back to the tornado of sharks. "We need to act now! The Terminator and I will take charge of this situation!"

The Terminator nods slightly, and Dr Who steps toward the front of the restaurant, followed by the Terminator.

I watch as they begin to fight against the incoming sharks, using their respective weapons and abilities. The tornado's force continues to pull more sharks into the restaurant, and the chaos is at its peak.

As they fight together, I notice that some of the patrons have begun to take refuge in the corners of the room, while others are still standing in confusion. The kitchen staff has also taken shelter, watching the action unfold.

The Terminator and Dr Who are working in tandem, firing their weapons at the sharks and using their strength to push them away. Dr Who occasionally stops to comment on the situation, his voice filled with excitement and curiosity.

"Did you know that the tornado of sharks is a rare event?" he asks, turning his attention back to me.

I nod, still in awe. "Yes! It's incredible!"

Dr Who smiles and continues to fight alongside the Terminator. The two of them are now a formidable team, working together against the overwhelming force of the tornado of sharks.

At this moment, I notice that one of the sharks is larger than the rest, and it's now focusing on me. I look at the creature in fear as it approaches me slowly, its eyes locked on mine.

"Hello, young lady!" Dr Who exclaims, pointing his weapon toward the shark. "Let's see how you handle this!"

The Terminator steps forward and fires his weapon at the large shark. The shot hits the creature's body, causing it to collapse in a heap.

I look at them in awe, my voice filled with gratitude and amazement.

"Thank you," I say, my voice trembling slightly.

Dr Who smiles and nods toward me. "You're welcome, young lady! Let's continue this fight!"

The Terminator and Dr Who continue to fight against the remaining sharks as the tornado begins to dissipate, and the chaos in the restaurant starts to settle down.

Eventually, the last of the sharks is eliminated, and the room is quiet. The patrons are now slowly returning to their seats, some still in awe and others relieved.

I look around at the scene, feeling a mix of emotions. The presence of both Dr Who and the Terminator has left an impact on me, and I feel grateful for their help.

Dr Who turns his attention back to me, his voice cheerful and energetic. "Well, young lady! I believe we have handled this situation quite well. What are your thoughts now?"

I smile and nod, my voice filled with gratitude and appreciation. "Thank you both. It's amazing what you've done here."

The Terminator nods slightly, his gaze still focused on the scene.

Dr Who smiles and turns back to me. "You're welcome! Let's enjoy our meal now!"

I nod and look at the menu again, feeling ready to make a choice.

As I begin to read the menu, I notice that Dr Who is standing beside me, still smiling, and the Terminator is standing slightly behind him, observing the scene with his usual monotone expression.

I take a deep breath, feeling relieved and grateful for the presence of both characters.

The restaurant now is a peaceful environment, with the echoes of the previous chaos fading away. I look around at the patrons, some of whom are still in awe of the event, others simply returning to their usual activities.

The tower's structure remains intact, and the chandelier now sways gently as people move around. The presence of both Dr Who and the Terminator has left an impression on me, and I feel confident in their abilities and their partnership.

As I finish reading the menu and decide on my order, I feel ready to proceed with the meal, knowing that the events have been resolved and that the environment is now stable.

Science Fiction: The Last Transmission - Write a story that takes place entirely within a spaceship's cockpit as the sole surviving crew member attempts to send a final message back to Earth before the ship's power runs out. The story should explore themes of isolation, sacrifice, and the importance of human connection in the face of adversity. If the situation calls for it, have the character(s) curse and swear (words like: shit, fuck, damn, hell, etc) to further the reader's emotional connection to them. 800-1000 words.
</B>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, so I need to write a story set entirely in a spaceship's cockpit with the sole surviving crew member trying to send a final message before power runs out. The themes are isolation, sacrifice, and human connection. Also, some swearing if needed.

First, the setting: a spaceship cockpit, probably old, maybe with some damage. The character is alone, so I need to convey that loneliness. Maybe they've been there for a while, dealing with previous failures or events that led to this moment.

The character should be struggling with sending the message, perhaps facing technical issues, time pressure, and emotional turmoil. They might be thinking about Earth, family, maybe past colleagues who are gone.

I need to include moments where the character shows frustration, maybe swearing when things aren't working. Also, the importance of human connection, maybe through memories or a message to someone specific.

Structure-wise, the story should build up tension as time runs out. Maybe the power is failing, and the character is fighting against the clock to complete the transmission.

Possible elements: countdown timer, malfunctioning systems, the character's past experiences, perhaps a moment of despair, then resolve to finish the message despite everything.

Need to make sure the themes are clear throughout. Maybe the character reflects on sacrifices made, the importance of staying connected even in isolation.

Also, ensuring that the language is appropriate for the situation, with realistic dialogue and emotions.

I need to check the length: 800-1000 words. So probably around 5-7 pages depending on font size.

Let me outline the key points:

- Introduction of the character, setting, and situation.
- The struggle with the transmission system, technical issues, time pressure.
- Emotional reflections on past colleagues, family, sacrifices.
- Climax as power is about to run out, final push to send the message.
- Resolution or closing scene.

Make sure to include the required elements: isolation, sacrifice, human connection, and appropriate swearing.

Now, writing the story with these elements in mind.

OUTPUT:

The Last Transmission

Captain Elias Voss stared at the flickering lights of the ship’s cockpit, the only human in a vast, silent void. His hands trembled as he adjusted the controls of the ancient communication array, a relic from the early days of interstellar travel. The screen glowed with red warnings, each one a reminder that time was running out.

“Just hold on a little longer,” he muttered, his voice echoing in the confined space. The ship’s power was dwindling faster than expected, and the countdown timer on the wall confirmed it: 02:15.

The array had been malfunctioning for hours, but now it was a race against time. He had already rebooted it three times, each time hoping for better results. Now, with only 2 hours and 15 minutes left, he pushed harder, cursing under his breath as the screen blinked erratically.

“Damn it! Why does this thing always fail when I need it most?” he shouted, slamming his fist against the control panel. A small crack spidered across the glass, but the screen finally stabilized, displaying a familiar interface.

“Okay, okay,” he sighed, exhaling deeply. “Let’s do this properly.”

He began to input the final message, his hands moving with practiced precision. The words were already written in his mind, repeated countless times during his long hours of solitude.

“Earth, this is Captain Elias Voss of the Hopeful Star. I’m sending this message from the cockpit… I’m alone… The ship is failing… We lost power… The crew… They’re gone…” His voice faltered slightly as he remembered the last moments before the tragedy.

Flashback

The ship had been on its third year of a 5-year mission, exploring distant star systems. The crew was a tight-knit group, each member relying on the others for survival. Then came the accident— a massive radiation leak that forced an emergency evacuation. The crew members were trapped in the lower decks, unable to escape as the ship’s systems began to fail.

“Shit!” Elias exclaimed, bringing himself back to the present. “I should have done more… I failed them…”

The memories of his crewmates flooded his mind—Dr. Lena Marquez, the ship’s chief medical officer; Engineer Tomasz Kowalski, the ship’s lead engineer; and even young officer Sarah Lin, who had only just joined the crew. They were all gone, lost in the chaos that followed.

“Damn! I should have… I could have…** fuck!**” He slammed his hands against the console again, frustration overwhelming him. “I’m sorry, guys…”

He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to gather his thoughts. The ship’s systems were failing faster now, and the timer was down to 01:45.

“I need to finish this,” he whispered, more to himself than anyone else. “They’re all gone… I’m the only one left…”

Present

He continued typing, his fingers moving with renewed urgency. The words were simple but heartfelt:

“…I apologize for not saving all of you. I failed them… But I will do my best to send this message… Please, tell my family… I love them… Tell them I’m sorry… Tell them I love them…”

He paused, looking at the screen as the timer ticked down to 01:20. His heart was pounding.

“Hell! This thing is still not working!” he shouted, his voice rising in frustration. “Come on, damn thing!”

The screen finally responded, displaying a green ‘Ready’ signal. He exhaled a sigh of relief, even as the timer continued to drop.

“Okay… Let’s send it… Now!”

He pressed the ‘Send’ button. The screen flickered once more, then a small light began to blink rapidly.

Final Moments

The timer now showed 00:15.

“God! Please… Work…” Elias prayed silently as the system continued to process the message.

As the last second approached, the screen finally displayed a confirmation: Message Sent.

The timer stopped at 00:00. The ship’s lights flickered once more before completely dimming.

End

In the silence that followed, Captain Elias Voss sat in his seat, eyes closed, tears streaming down his face. The message had been sent. He was alone, but no longer isolated. His final words had reached Earth, a testament to his love, his sorrow, and his sacrifice.

“I love you… My family…”

The end.

<B>
Come up with six plots for a new "Black Mirror" episode (that the audience would love) that all involve time travel with sexy theme(s).
</B>

[[[thinking start]]]

Okay, I need to come up with six different plot ideas for a new Black Mirror episode that all involve time travel and have a sexy theme. Let's start by recalling what Black Mirror usually does. Each episode is a standalone story, often exploring the darker or more complex sides of technology. Time travel is a common trope, but combining it with a sexy theme requires some creativity.

First idea: Maybe something involving a time loop where a character can reset the day to fix a missed opportunity, perhaps with a romantic interest. Like the movie "Groundhog Day" but with a more sinister twist. Maybe the protagonist keeps getting the same day over and over, trying to get the woman he loves to accept him. But in Black Mirror style, maybe there's a hidden cost or a twist that makes it more complex.

Wait, but I need to make sure each plot is different. Let me think of other possibilities. What if the time travel is tied to a device or technology that allows people to go back in time for short periods, but only when they are in love with someone else? Maybe the technology only works when the user is in a romantic relationship, or when they are in love with another person.

Another idea: A person discovers a device that lets them travel back in time to any moment, but every time they use it, their body changes slightly. For example, the first time they go back, they're the same age, then the next time they're slightly older, etc. But with a sexy element, perhaps each change affects their appearance, making them more attractive over time, leading to multiple relationships across different time periods.

Alternatively, a scenario where two people meet through time travel, and their relationship evolves across different timelines, but each time they meet, they have a new version of themselves, creating different romantic scenarios. Maybe a couple who keep meeting in different times, with each encounter having a different level of intimacy or relationship progress.

Wait, but how to make each plot unique? Let me think again.

Maybe the first plot is about a man who can time travel to meet his past love, but each time he changes something minor, it affects their future relationship. For example, the first time he changes a small thing, they end up together, but then in another iteration, they break up. The twist could be that he's not just changing the past, but also the present, leading to confusion and multiple relationships.

Another idea: A woman finds a time machine that allows her to go back to different moments in her life, each time with a new partner. The theme is about how she can choose any partner from any time period, but the technology only works if she's in a romantic relationship at the moment. Each episode might have different characters and situations.

Alternatively, a plot where a man uses a time travel device to go back to different times to meet his love in each era, with the challenge being that each time he changes the past, it affects his present life, and he has to choose between multiple possible futures.

Wait, but I need to ensure each of the six plots is distinct and has a unique twist. Let me list them again.

First plot: Time loop where a man keeps reliving the same day to win a woman's love, but each reset causes a change in his appearance, making him more attractive over time.

Second plot: A woman uses a time machine to revisit different moments in her life, each time with a new partner, and the device only works when she's in a romantic relationship.

Third plot: A couple meet through time travel, and their relationship evolves across multiple timelines, with each encounter having different levels of intimacy and connection.

Fourth plot: A man who can travel back in time to meet his past love, but each change he makes affects future relationships, leading to a series of conflicting outcomes.

Fifth plot: A device that allows time travel for short periods, but each use changes the user's physical appearance, leading to different romantic scenarios with various partners.

Sixth plot: A woman who uses a time machine to meet multiple partners from different times, where each encounter has a unique romantic challenge.

Wait, but I need to make sure each plot is unique and not overlapping. Let me check again. Maybe the fifth and sixth plots are similar, but perhaps with slight differences.

Alternatively, the sixth plot could be about a man who uses the time machine to meet different partners across various eras, with each encounter having a specific challenge related to the era's culture or technology.

I think these six ideas should cover different scenarios, each with a unique twist involving time travel and a sexy theme. Now, I need to ensure they are distinct enough and fit within the Black Mirror style.

[[[thinking end]]]
