# Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1


## Model Overview 

Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1 is a large language model (LLM) which is a derivative of [Meta Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct) (AKA the reference model). It is a reasoning model that is post trained for reasoning, human chat preferences, and tasks, such as RAG and tool calling. 

Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1 is a model which offers a great tradeoff between model accuracy and efficiency. It is created from Llama 3.1 8B Instruct and offers improvements in model accuracy. The model fits on a single RTX GPU and can be used locally. The model supports a context length of 128K.

This model underwent a multi-phase post-training process to enhance both its reasoning and non-reasoning capabilities. This includes a supervised fine-tuning stage for Math, Code, Reasoning, and Tool Calling as well as multiple reinforcement learning (RL) stages using REINFORCE (RLOO) and Online Reward-aware Preference Optimization (RPO) algorithms for both chat and instruction-following. The final model checkpoint is obtained after merging the final SFT and Online RPO checkpoints. Improved using Qwen.

This model is part of the Llama Nemotron Collection. You can find the other model(s) in this family here: 
[Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-3.3-Nemotron-Super-49B-v1)

This model is ready for commercial use.

## Quick Start and Usage Recommendations:

1. Reasoning mode (ON/OFF) is controlled via the system prompt, which must be set as shown in the example below. All instructions should be contained within the user prompt
2. We recommend setting temperature to `0.6`, and Top P to `0.95` for Reasoning ON mode
3. We recommend using greedy decoding for Reasoning OFF mode
4. We have provided a list of prompts to use for evaluation for each benchmark where a specific template is required
5. The model will include `<think></think>` if no reasoning was necessary in Reasoning ON model, this is expected behaviour

You can try this model out through the preview API, using this link: [Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/llama-3_1-nemotron-nano-8b-v1).

See the snippet below for usage with Hugging Face Transformers library. Reasoning mode (ON/OFF) is controlled via system prompt. Please see the example below.
Our code requires the transformers package version to be `4.44.2` or higher.


### Example of “Reasoning On:”

```python
import torch
import transformers

model_id = "nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1"
model_kwargs = {"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16, "device_map": "auto"}
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
   "text-generation",
   model=model_id,
   tokenizer=tokenizer,
   max_new_tokens=32768,
   temperature=0.6,
   top_p=0.95,
   **model_kwargs
)

# Thinking can be "on" or "off"
thinking = "on"

print(pipeline([{"role": "system", "content": f"detailed thinking {thinking}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Solve x*(sin(x)+2)=0"}]))
```


### Example of “Reasoning Off:”

```python
import torch
import transformers

model_id = "nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1"
model_kwargs = {"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16, "device_map": "auto"}
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
   "text-generation",
   model=model_id,
   tokenizer=tokenizer,
   max_new_tokens=32768,
   do_sample=False,
   **model_kwargs
)

# Thinking can be "on" or "off"
thinking = "off"

print(pipeline([{"role": "system", "content": f"detailed thinking {thinking}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Solve x*(sin(x)+2)=0"}]))
```

For some prompts, even though thinking is disabled, the model emergently prefers to think before responding. But if desired, the users can prevent it by pre-filling the assistant response.

```python
import torch
import transformers

model_id = "nvidia/Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1"
model_kwargs = {"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16, "device_map": "auto"}
tokenizer = transformers.AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_id)
tokenizer.pad_token_id = tokenizer.eos_token_id

# Thinking can be "on" or "off"
thinking = "off"

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
   "text-generation",
   model=model_id,
   tokenizer=tokenizer,
   max_new_tokens=32768,
   do_sample=False,
   **model_kwargs
)

print(pipeline([{"role": "system", "content": f"detailed thinking {thinking}"}, {"role": "user", "content": "Solve x*(sin(x)+2)=0"}, {"role":"assistant", "content":"<think>\n</think>"}]))
```

## Training Datasets

A large variety of training data was used for the post-training pipeline, including manually annotated data and synthetic data.

The data for the multi-stage post-training phases for improvements in Code, Math, and Reasoning is a compilation of SFT and RL data that supports improvements of math, code, general reasoning, and instruction following capabilities of the original Llama instruct model. 

Prompts have been sourced from either public and open corpus or synthetically generated. Responses were synthetically generated by a variety of models, with some prompts containing responses for both Reasoning On and Off modes, to train the model to distinguish between two modes. 

**Data Collection for Training Datasets:** <br>
* Hybrid: Automated, Human, Synthetic <br>

**Data Labeling for Training Datasets:** <br>
* N/A <br>

## Evaluation Datasets

We used the datasets listed below to evaluate Llama-3.1-Nemotron-Nano-8B-v1. 

**Data Collection for Evaluation Datasets:** Hybrid: Human/Synthetic

**Data Labeling for Evaluation Datasets:** Hybrid: Human/Synthetic/Automatic

## Evaluation Results

These results contain both “Reasoning On”, and “Reasoning Off”. We recommend using temperature=`0.6`, top_p=`0.95` for “Reasoning On” mode, and greedy decoding for “Reasoning Off” mode. All evaluations are done with 32k sequence length. We run the benchmarks up to 16 times and average the scores to be more accurate.
