# OpenMath-Nemotron-1.5B

OpenMath-Nemotron-1.5B is created by finetuning [Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B) on [OpenMathReasoning](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenMathReasoning) dataset.
This model is ready for commercial use.

![Evaluation Results](./results.png)


OpenMath-Nemotron models achieve state-of-the-art results on popular mathematical benchmarks. We present metrics as pass@1 (maj@64) where pass@1
is an average accuracy across 64 generations and maj@64 is the result of majority voting. 
Please see our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16891) for more details on the evaluation setup.

We used [a version of OpenMath-Nemotron-14B](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/OpenMath-Nemotron-14B-Kaggle) model to secure 
the first place in [AIMO-2 Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-mathematical-olympiad-progress-prize-2/leaderboard)!

## Reproducing our results

The pipeline we used to produce the data and models is fully open-sourced!

- [Code](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo-Skills)
- [Models](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/openmathreasoning-68072c0154a5099573d2e730)
- [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/OpenMathReasoning)
- [Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16891)

We provide [all instructions](https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo-Skills/openmathreasoning1/)
to fully reproduce our results, including data generation.

## How to use the models?

Our models can be used in 3 inference modes: chain-of-thought (CoT), tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) and generative solution selection (GenSelect).

To run inference with CoT mode, you can use this example code snippet.

```python
import transformers
import torch

model_id = "nvidia/OpenMath-Nemotron-1.5B"

pipeline = transformers.pipeline(
    "text-generation",
    model=model_id,
    model_kwargs={"torch_dtype": torch.bfloat16},
    device_map="auto",
)

messages = [
    {
        "role": "user", 
        "content": "Solve the following math problem. Make sure to put the answer (and only answer) inside \\boxed{}.

" + 
        "What is the minimum value of $a^2+6a-7$?"},
]

outputs = pipeline(
    messages,
    max_new_tokens=4096,
)
print(outputs[0]["generated_text"][-1]['content'])
```

To run inference with TIR or GenSelect modes, we highly recommend to use our 
[reference implementation in NeMo-Skills](https://nvidia.github.io/NeMo-Skills/openmathreasoning1/evaluation/).

Please note that these models have not been instruction tuned on general data and thus might not provide good answers outside of math domain.
