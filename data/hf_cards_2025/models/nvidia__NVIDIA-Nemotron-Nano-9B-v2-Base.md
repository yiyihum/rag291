Our AI models are designed and optimized to run on NVIDIA GPU-accelerated systems. By leveraging NVIDIA’s hardware (e.g. GPU cores) and software frameworks (e.g., CUDA libraries), the model achieves faster training and inference times compared to CPU-only solutions.

## Software Integration

- Runtime Engine(s): NeMo 25.07.nemotron-nano-v2  
- Supported Hardware Microarchitecture Compatibility: NVIDIA A10G, NVIDIA H100-80GB, NVIDIA A100  
- Operating System(s): Linux


The integration of foundation and fine-tuned models into AI systems requires additional testing using use-case-specific data to ensure safe and effective deployment. Following the V-model methodology, iterative testing and validation at both unit and system levels are essential to mitigate risks, meet technical and functional requirements, and ensure compliance with safety and ethical standards before deployment.

## Model Version(s)

- v1.0

# Training, Testing, and Evaluation Datasets:

NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2-Base is pre-trained on a large corpus of high-quality curated and synthetically-generated data. It is trained in the English language, as well as 15 multilingual languages and 43 programming languages. Our sources cover a variety of document types such as: webpages, dialogue, articles, and other written materials. The corpus spans domains including legal, math, science, finance, and more. We also include a small portion of question-answering, and alignment style data to improve model accuracy. The model was trained for approximately twenty trillion tokens.

Alongside the model, we release our [final pretraining data](https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-pre-training-dataset-689d9de36f84279d83786b35), as outlined in this section. For ease of analysis, there is a sample set that is ungated. For all remaining code, math and multilingual data, gating and approval is required, and the dataset is permissively licensed for model training purposes.

**Data Modality:**  Text **The total size:**  10,648,823,153,919 Tokens **Total number of datasets:** 141 **Dataset partition:** *Training \[100%\], testing \[0%\], validation \[0%\]*  
**Time period for training data collection:** 2013 to May 1, 2025  
**Time period for testing data collection:** 2013 to May 1, 2025

## Crawled and Scraped from Online Sources by NVIDIA

The English Common Crawl data was downloaded from the Common Crawl Foundation (see their FAQ for details on their crawling) and includes the snapshots CC-MAIN-2013-20 through CC-MAIN-2025-13. The data was subsequently deduplicated and filtered in various ways described in the Nemotron-CC paper. Additionally, we extracted data for fifteen languages from the following three Common Crawl snapshots: CC-MAIN-2024-51, CC-MAIN-2025-08, CC-MAIN-2025-18. The fifteen languages included were Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Thai. As we did not have reliable multilingual model-based quality classifiers available, we applied just heuristic filtering instead—similar to what we did for lower quality English data in the Nemotron-CC pipeline, but selectively removing some filters for some languages that did not work well. Deduplication was done in the same way as for Nemotron-CC.

The GitHub Crawl was collected using the GitHub REST API and the Amazon S3 API. Each crawl was operated in accordance with the rate limits set by its respective source, either GitHub or S3. We collect raw source code and subsequently remove any having a license which does not exist in our permissive-license set (for additional details, refer to the technical report).

We use a considerable amount of synthetic data. Out of 10.6 trillion tokens, 3,534,013,958,278 tokens are synthetically generated.

We extracted data for fifteen languages from the following three Common Crawl snapshots: CC-MAIN-2024-51, CC-MAIN-2025-08, CC-MAIN-2025-18. The fifteen languages included were Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, and Thai. As we did not have reliable multilingual model-based quality classifiers available, we applied just heuristic filtering instead—similar to what we did for lower quality English data in the Nemotron-CC pipeline, but selectively removing some filters for some languages that did not work well. Deduplication was done in the same way as for Nemotron-CC. Additionally, we used data from Wikipedia and FineWeb-2 (Penedo et al., 2025\) for these fifteen languages.
