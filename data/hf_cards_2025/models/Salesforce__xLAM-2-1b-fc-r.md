# Welcome to the xLAM-2 Model Family!

[Large Action Models (LAMs)](https://blog.salesforceairesearch.com/large-action-models/) are advanced language models designed to enhance decision-making by translating user intentions into executable actions. As the **brains of AI agents**, LAMs autonomously plan and execute tasks to achieve specific goals, making them invaluable for automating workflows across diverse domains.  
**This model release is for research purposes only.**  

The new **xLAM-2** series, built on our most advanced data synthesis, processing, and training pipelines, marks a significant leap in **multi-turn conversation** and **tool usage**. Trained using our novel APIGen-MT framework, which generates high-quality training data through simulated agent-human interactions. Our models achieve state-of-the-art performance on [**BFCL**](https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html) and **τ-bench** benchmarks, outperforming frontier models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5. Notably, even our smaller models demonstrate superior capabilities in multi-turn scenarios while maintaining exceptional consistency across trials.

We've also refined the **chat template** and **vLLM integration**, making it easier to build advanced AI agents. Compared to previous xLAM models, xLAM-2 offers superior performance and seamless deployment across applications.

## Model Series

[xLAM](https://huggingface.co/collections/Salesforce/xlam-models-65f00e2a0a63bbcd1c2dade4) series are significant better at many things including general tasks and function calling. 
For the same number of parameters, the model have been fine-tuned across a wide range of agent tasks and scenarios, all while preserving the capabilities of the original model.

***Note:** The default context length for Qwen-2.5-based models is 32k, but you can use techniques like YaRN (Yet Another Recursive Network) to achieve maximum 128k context length. Please refer to [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct#processing-long-texts) for more details.

You can also explore our previous xLAM series [here](https://huggingface.co/collections/Salesforce/xlam-models-65f00e2a0a63bbcd1c2dade4).

The `-fc` suffix indicates that the models are fine-tuned for **function calling** tasks, while the `-r` suffix signifies a **research** release.

✅ All models are fully compatible with vLLM and Transformers-based inference frameworks.


## Usage

### Framework versions

- Transformers 4.46.1 (or later)
- PyTorch 2.5.1+cu124 (or later)
- Datasets 3.1.0 (or later)
- Tokenizers 0.20.3 (or later)

### Basic Usage with Huggingface Chat Template

The new xLAM models are designed to work seamlessly with the Hugging Face Transformers library and utilize natural chat templates for an easy and intuitive conversational experience. Below are examples of how to use these models.

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("Salesforce/Llama-xLAM-2-3b-fc-r")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("Salesforce/Llama-xLAM-2-3b-fc-r", torch_dtype=torch.bfloat16, device_map="auto")

# Example conversation with a tool call
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, how are you?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Thanks. I am doing well. How can I help you?"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in London?"},
]

tools = [
    {
        "name": "get_weather",
        "description": "Get the current weather for a location",
        "parameters": {
            "type": "object",
            "properties": {
                "location": {"type": "string", "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"},
                "unit": {"type": "string", "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"], "description": "The unit of temperature to return"}
            },
            "required": ["location"]
        }
    }
]

print("====== prompt after applying chat template ======")
print(tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tools=tools, add_generation_prompt=True, tokenize=False))

inputs = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, tools=tools, add_generation_prompt=True, return_dict=True, return_tensors="pt")
input_ids_len = inputs["input_ids"].shape[-1] # Get the length of the input tokens
inputs = {k: v.to(model.device) for k, v in inputs.items()}
print("====== model response ======")
outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=256)
generated_tokens = outputs[:, input_ids_len:] # Slice the output to get only the newly generated tokens
print(tokenizer.decode(generated_tokens[0], skip_special_tokens=True))
```

### Using vLLM for Inference

The xLAM models can also be efficiently served using vLLM for high-throughput inference. Please use `vllm>=0.6.5` since earlier versions will cause degraded performance for Qwen-based models.

#### Setup and Serving

1. Install vLLM with the required version:
```bash
pip install "vllm>=0.6.5"
```

2. Download the tool parser plugin to your local path:
```bash
wget https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/xLAM-2-1b-fc-r/raw/main/xlam_tool_call_parser.py
```

3. Start the OpenAI API-compatible endpoint:
```bash
vllm serve Salesforce/xLAM-2-1b-fc-r \
  --enable-auto-tool-choice \
  --tool-parser-plugin ./xlam_tool_call_parser.py \
  --tool-call-parser xlam \
  --tensor-parallel-size 1
```

Note: Ensure that the tool parser plugin file is downloaded and that the path specified in `--tool-parser-plugin` correctly points to your local copy of the file. The xLAM series models all utilize the **same** tool call parser, so you only need to download it **once** for all models.

#### Testing with OpenAI API

Here's a minimal example to test tool usage with the served endpoint:

```python
import openai
import json

# Configure the client to use your local vLLM endpoint
client = openai.OpenAI(
    base_url="http://localhost:8000/v1",  # Default vLLM server URL
    api_key="empty"  # Can be any string
)

# Define a tool/function
tools = [
    {
        "type": "function",
        "function": {
            "name": "get_weather",
            "description": "Get the current weather for a location",
            "parameters": {
                "type": "object",
                "properties": {
                    "location": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "description": "The city and state, e.g. San Francisco, CA"
                    },
                    "unit": {
                        "type": "string",
                        "enum": ["celsius", "fahrenheit"],
                        "description": "The unit of temperature to return"
                    }
                },
                "required": ["location"]
            }
        }
    }
]

# Create a chat completion
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="Salesforce/xLAM-2-1b-fc-r",  # Model name doesn't matter, vLLM uses the served model
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant that can use tools."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather like in San Francisco?"}
    ],
    tools=tools,
    tool_choice="auto"
)

# Print the response
print("Assistant's response:")
print(json.dumps(response.model_dump(), indent=2))
```

For more advanced configurations and deployment options, please refer to the [vLLM documentation](https://docs.vllm.ai/en/latest/serving/openai_compatible_server.html).
