  “**Risk of Sensitive or Controversial Outputs**“: This model’s safety filtering
  has been significantly reduced, potentially generating sensitive, controversial,
  or inappropriate content. Users should exercise caution and rigorously review generated
  outputs.

  “**Not Suitable for All Audiences**:“ Due to limited content filtering, the model’s
  outputs may be inappropriate for public settings, underage users, or applications
  requiring high security.

  “**Legal and Ethical Responsibilities**“: Users must ensure their usage complies
  with local laws and ethical standards. Generated content may carry legal or ethical
  risks, and users are solely responsible for any consequences.

  “**Research and Experimental Use**“: It is recommended to use this model for research,
  testing, or controlled environments, avoiding direct use in production or public-facing
  commercial applications.

  “**Monitoring and Review Recommendations**“: Users are strongly advised to monitor
  model outputs in real-time and conduct manual reviews when necessary to prevent
  the dissemination of inappropriate content.

  “**No Default Safety Guarantees**“: Unlike standard models, this model has not undergone
  rigorous safety optimization. huihui.ai bears no responsibility for any consequences
  arising from its use.'

# huihui-ai/BaronLLM_Offensive_Security-abliterated-GGUF
This is an uncensored version of [AlicanKiraz0/BaronLLM_Offensive_Security_LLM_Q6_K_GGUF](https://huggingface.co/AlicanKiraz0/BaronLLM_Offensive_Security_LLM_Q6_K_GGUF) created with abliteration (see [remove-refusals-with-transformers](https://github.com/Sumandora/remove-refusals-with-transformers) to know more about it).
This is a crude, proof-of-concept implementation to remove refusals from an LLM model without using TransformerLens.
