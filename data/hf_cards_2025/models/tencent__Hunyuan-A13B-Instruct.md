## Use with transformers

Our model defaults to using slow-thinking reasoning, and there are two ways to disable CoT reasoning. 
1. Pass "enable_thinking=False" when calling apply_chat_template.
2. Adding "/no_think" before the prompt will force the model not to use perform CoT reasoning. Similarly, adding "/think" before the prompt will force the model to perform CoT reasoning.

The following code snippet shows how to use the transformers library to load and apply the model. 
It also demonstrates how to enable and disable the reasoning mode , 
and how to parse the reasoning process along with the final output.



```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
import os
import re

model_name_or_path = os.environ['MODEL_PATH']
# model_name_or_path = "tencent/Hunyuan-A13B-Instruct"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name_or_path, device_map="auto",trust_remote_code=True)  # You may want to use bfloat16 and/or move to GPU here
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Write a short summary of the benefits of regular exercise"},
]

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
            messages,
            tokenize=False,
            enable_thinking=True
            )

model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)
model_inputs.pop("token_type_ids", None)
outputs = model.generate(**model_inputs, max_new_tokens=4096)


output_text = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0])

think_pattern = r'<think>(.*?)</think>'
think_matches = re.findall(think_pattern, output_text, re.DOTALL)

answer_pattern = r'<answer>(.*?)</answer>'
answer_matches = re.findall(answer_pattern, output_text, re.DOTALL)

think_content = [match.strip() for match in think_matches][0]
answer_content = [match.strip() for match in answer_matches][0]
print(f"thinking_content:{think_content}\n\n")
print(f"answer_content:{answer_content}\n\n")
```

### Fast and slow thinking switch

This model supports two modes of operation:

- Slow Thinking Mode (Default): Enables detailed internal reasoning steps before producing the final answer.
- Fast Thinking Mode: Skips the internal reasoning process for faster inference, going straight to the final answer.

**Switching to Fast Thinking Mode:**

To disable the reasoning process, set `enable_thinking=False` in the apply_chat_template call:
```

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
            messages,
            tokenize=False,
            enable_thinking=False
            )
```                                           



## Deployment   

For deployment, you can use frameworks such as **TensorRT-LLM**, **vLLM**, or **SGLang** to serve the model and create an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint.

```

### Source Code
Support for this model has been added via  this [PR 20114](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/20114 ) in the vLLM project, 
This patch already been merged by community at Jul-1-2025.

You can build and run vLLM from source using code after `ecad85`.

### Model Context Length Support

The Hunyuan A13B model supports a maximum context length of **256K tokens (262,144 tokens)**. However, due to GPU memory constraints on most hardware setups, the default configuration in `config.json` limits the context length to **32K tokens** to prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors.

#### Extending Context Length to 256K

To enable full 256K context support, you can manually modify the `max_position_embeddings` field in the model's `config.json` file as follows:

```json
{
  ...
  "max_position_embeddings": 262144,
  ...
}
```

When serving the model using **vLLM**, you can also explicitly set the maximum model length by adding the following flag to your server launch command:

```bash
--max-model-len 262144
```

#### Recommended Configuration for 256K Context Length

The following configuration is recommended for deploying the model with 256K context length support on systems equipped with **NVIDIA H20 GPUs (96GB VRAM)**:

| Model DType    | KV-Cache Dtype | Number of Devices | Model Length |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------|--------------|
| `bfloat16`     | `bfloat16`     | 4                  | 262,144      |

> ⚠️ **Note:** Using FP8 quantization for KV-cache may impact generation quality. The above settings are suggested configurations for stable 256K-length service deployment.


#### Tool Calling with vLLM

To support agent-based workflows and function calling capabilities, this model includes specialized parsing mechanisms for handling tool calls and internal reasoning steps.

For a complete working example of how to implement and use these features in an agent setting, please refer to our full agent implementation on GitHub:  
🔗 [Hunyuan A13B Agent Example](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan-A13B/blob/main/agent/)

When deploying the model using **vLLM**, the following parameters can be used to configure the tool parsing behavior:

| Parameter                | Value                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `--tool-parser-plugin`   | [Local Hunyuan A13B Tool Parser File](https://github.com/Tencent-Hunyuan/Hunyuan-A13B/blob/main/agent/hunyuan_tool_parser.py) |
| `--tool-call-parser`     | `hunyuan`                                                            |

These settings enable vLLM to correctly interpret and route tool calls generated by the model according to the expected format.

### Reasoning parser

vLLM reasoning parser support on Hunyuan A13B model is under development.
