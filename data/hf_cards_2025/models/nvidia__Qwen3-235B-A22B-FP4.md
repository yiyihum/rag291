# Model Overview

## Description:
The NVIDIA Qwen3-235B-A22B FP4 model is the quantized version of Alibaba's Qwen3-235B-A22B model, which is an auto-regressive language model that uses an optimized transformer architecture. For more information, please check [here](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-235B-A22B). The NVIDIA Qwen3-235B-A22B FP4 model is quantized with [TensorRT Model Optimizer](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer).

This model is ready for commercial/non-commercial use.  <br>

## Inference:
**Engine:** TensorRT-LLM <br>
**Test Hardware:** B200 <br>

## Post Training Quantization
This model was obtained by quantizing the weights and activations of Qwen3-235B-A22B to FP4 data type, ready for inference with TensorRT-LLM. Only the weights and activations of the linear operators within transformer blocks are quantized. This optimization reduces the number of bits per parameter from 16 to 4, reducing the disk size and GPU memory requirements by approximately 3.3x.

## Usage

### Deploy with TensorRT-LLM

To deploy the quantized checkpoint with [TensorRT-LLM](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM) LLM API, follow the sample codes below:

* LLM API sample usage:
```
from tensorrt_llm import LLM, SamplingParams


def main():

    prompts = [
        "Hello, my name is",
        "The president of the United States is",
        "The capital of France is",
        "The future of AI is",
    ]
    sampling_params = SamplingParams(temperature=0.8, top_p=0.95)

    llm = LLM(model="nvidia/Qwen3-235B-A22B-FP4", tensor_parallel_size=4)

    outputs = llm.generate(prompts, sampling_params)

    # Print the outputs.
    for output in outputs:
        prompt = output.prompt
        generated_text = output.outputs[0].text
        print(f"Prompt: {prompt!r}, Generated text: {generated_text!r}")


# The entry point of the program needs to be protected for spawning processes.
if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()

```
