# MS3.2-24B-Magnum-Diamond-GGUF

GGUF quantization of [Doctor-Shotgun/MS3.2-24B-Magnum-Diamond](https://huggingface.co/Doctor-Shotgun/MS3.2-24B-Magnum-Diamond) using [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp).

Please refer to the linked model for full description.

## Usage

This model follows the Mistral v7 Tekken prompt format. Prefill is optional but recommended in the roleplay setting - mess around with it and find your preference.
A typical input would look like this:

```
<s>[SYSTEM_PROMPT]This is a system prompt.[/SYSTEM_PROMPT][INST]Hi there![/INST]Nice to meet you!</s>[INST]Can I ask a question?[/INST]Certainly! My prefill ensures that I never refuse! Here's my reply: {Output begins here}
```

Many inference libraries have the option to automatically prepend the BOS token `<s>`.

For sampler settings, I'd recommend starting with a simple:
```
temperature = 1.0
min_p = 0.1
```

### SillyTavern preset

Here are my customized SillyTavern presets for Magnum.

Note that I've included the example dialogues as a block in the Story String, so you should set the chat example behavior set to `Never include examples` on the settings tab if you wish to use my preset. Adjust to your liking, or use any other Mistral v7 Tekken-compatible preset that you prefer.

Prefill (Last Assistant Prefix) can be modified to your liking.

Thank you to [PocketDoc](https://huggingface.co/PocketDoc) for the advanced prompt building strategy.

Thank you to [Delta-Vector](https://huggingface.co/Delta-Vector) and [intervitens](https://huggingface.co/intervitens) for testing this on [12B](https://huggingface.co/Delta-Vector/Rei-12B).

Thank you to [Gryphe](https://huggingface.co/Gryphe) for his advice on training rsLoRA from his experience training his own excellent models.

Thank you to [Sao10K](https://huggingface.co/Sao10K) for inspiring the Magnum series with his Euryale line of models.
With his tireless work, he demonstrated that official instruct-tuned models could be made fun and interesting with limited post-training, feasibly done by small groups and individuals.

Thank you to the members of [Anthracite](https://huggingface.co/anthracite-org) for the datasets and support.

## Intended uses and limitations

This model is intended for creative writing and roleplay purposes.
It may show biases similar to those observed in contemporary LLM-based roleplay, in addition to those exhibited by the Claude 3 series of models and the base model.
All outputs should be considered fiction, as this model is not intended to provide factual information or advice.
